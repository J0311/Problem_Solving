# Problem_Solving

## This repository will be dedicated to exhibiting simple (and maybe even innovative) solutions to commonly faced problems. 

## Problems may range anywhere from cleaning up decimal/numeric format, to String or array manipulation (e.g., capitalization of a String phrase, printing the sum of array duplicates, etc.).

## The "Problem_Solving" repository will serve as a good reference point for problem solving with future programs.
